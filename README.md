# wikiracer
This is wiki racer! It takes in a starting word and an end word and will start on the starting word's wiki page and return a ladder that contains all the words' wiki pages that it took to get to the end page!
Start by putting two words of your choice that have wikipedia pages into the input of the wikiracer.java and run the code.
